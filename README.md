# Coco, the bedtime clock

## What is it
This is Coco, a bedtime indicator for children.\
It's an Open Source piece of software running on an Open Source piece of hardware, namely the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi.

The combination of both hardware and software makes a device designed to help children sleep when it's time to; and also don't get up too early ðŸ˜„

## How to use
On your side, you can replicate the device and use it freely, as soon as you have an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi board programmed with the "Coco" software.

1. Buy an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi, if you don't have one yet. Please buy a genuine one, if you can afford.
2. Get the Arduino IDE software or run it from the Cloud.
3. Download the source code from GitHub, or `git clone` the project.
4. Open the [main project file](coco_bedtime_clock/coco_bedtime_clock.ino) into the Arduino IDE, compile and run the program on your board.
